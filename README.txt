This Minesweeper version requires the user to interact via command lines.
There are 5 possible difficulties, which vary the size of the board and the number of mines.
Boards are generated randomly, to increase replayability.
When the user selects a cell with no adjacent mines, the board automatically unveils all the empty cells adjacent to it.
Future work: include record of previous games, include time to beat the game, check if the best time has been beaten for the selected difficulty.

For further details of implementation and functionality, please check each file.
